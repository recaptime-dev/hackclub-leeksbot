# Coding style

We'll be setting up eslint and prettier later in the code, but here's a gist of the coding style
for this project in the meanwhile:

* Use spaces not tab, at least 2 spaces per indentation.
* No `;` at the end (for now)
* For local imports, we're not yet requiring file extensions yet but we'll flip
the flag on our TS configs.

We'll update this documentation for more details once linting and formatting tools
are enabled here. Patches are much welcome to improve our coding style, including
configurations and tooling. :)
